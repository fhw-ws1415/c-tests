Usage: ueb03 POLYNOM Y A0 B0 MAXSTEPS DISPLAY
       -> compute a point x where POLYNOM(x) = Y
           Y: The value of the POLYNOM at point x
           A0 / B0: starting values for Regula Falsi
           MAXSTEPS: maximum number of iterations
           DISPLAY: a non-empty sequence of
              x: display x
              c: display canonical form of input polynom
              g: display graph
           f.e. xc to display the computed point x and the canonical form of the polynom
  or:  ueb03 -h ->  print this information

The `POLYNOM` is a sum of terms of the form ax^b where a is the coefficient and b is the exponent.
Sequences of whitespace as accepted by the C standard function `sscanf()` are allowed in front of 
each a (where the sign belongs to the a, i.e. no whitespace is allowed between sign and number) and 
each b; apart from that no whitespace is permitted.
e.g.: "4.5x^2+2.0x^1+7.12x^2-9.0098x^0""
e.g.: " 4.0x^ 2 +2.0x^ 1"
